# Market Timing Research

This repository consolidates four independent market timing strategies, each located in its own subfolder:

- **Volatility-and-Turnover**  
  Investigates volatility and turnover-based indicators for tactical market entry.

- **ICU Timing Model**  
  A custom timing signal derived from intraday volatility and momentum curves.

- **LLT Slope Reversal**  
  Detects turning points using the slope of linear lag transformations (LLT).

- **RSRS Market Timing**  
  Applies RSRS (Regression Slope of Relative Strength) to signal market regime shifts.
